However, the adoption of peer assessment can be slow and uncomfortably experienced by students. Moreover, peer assessment can be prone to several biases. In this paper, we argue that the analysis of peer assessment interactions and phenomena can benefit from the social network analysis domain. We applied a graphlet-based method to a dataset collected during in-class courses integrating a peer assessment platform. This allowed for the interpretation of networking structures shaping the peer assessment interactions, leading for the description of consequent peer assessment roles and their temporal dynamics. Results showed that students develop a positive tendency towards adopting the peer assessment process, and engage gradually with well-balanced roles, even though, initially they choose mostly to be assessed by teachers and more likely by peers they know. This study contributes to research insights into peer assessment learning analytics, and motivates future work to scaffold peer learning in similar contexts.","tags":["peer assessment","temporal networks","graphlets"],"title":"Analysing Peer Assessment Interactions and Their Temporal Dynamics Using a Graphlet-Based Method","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Wahiu","Fahima Djelil","Laurent Brisson","Jean-Marie Gilliot","Antoine Beugnard"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1619136000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644251491,"objectID":"84caf3bbbbdd3778760d2f0d7bf5c064","permalink":"http://www.laurent-brisson.fr/publication/2021-analysing-student-engagement-online-course-hybrid-learning-environment/","publishdate":"2021-04-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-analysing-student-engagement-online-course-hybrid-learning-environment/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper aims to understand student learning engagement in an online course.

Nevertheless, it is still very challenging for practitioners to choose in each particular case the most suitable algorithm which would provide the richest insights into the structure of the social network they study. Through a case study of the French crowdfunding platform, Ulule, this paper demonstrates an original methodology for the selection of a relevant algorithm. For this purpose we, firstly, compare the partitions of 11 well-known algorithms. Then, bivariate map based on hub dominance and transitivity is used to identify the partitions which unveil communities with the most interesting size and internal topologies. These steps result in three community detection methods relevant for our data. Finally, we add the socioeconomic indicators, meaningful in the framework of the crowdfunding platform, in order to select the most significant algorithm of community detection, and to analyze the cooperation patterns among the platform's users and their impact on success of fundraising campaigns. In line with previous socioeconomic studies, we demonstrate that the social concept of homophily in online groups really matters. In addition, our approach puts in light that crowdfunding groups may benefit from diversity.","tags":["crowdfunding","online cooperation","complex networks","choice of method","community detection","social network analysis"],"title":"How to Choose Community Detection Methods in Complex Networks: The Case Study of Ulule Crowdfunding Platform","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Raphaël Charbey","Laurent Brisson","Cécile Bothorel"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1601510400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644251491,"objectID":"f8121b5f44cbc1f495bd1c53bf1a3410","permalink":"http://www.laurent-brisson.fr/publication/2020-enumeration-motifs-graphe-evolution-communautes/","publishdate":"2020-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-enumeration-motifs-graphe-evolution-communautes/","section":"publication","summary":"Comprendre la dynamique des interactions entre individus dans les réseaux sociaux est un enjeu important, notamment via la dynamique communautaire.

Elle permet de modéliser et de visualiser ces réseaux d’ac-teurs à l’aide de graphes où on peut souvent trouver des regroupements d’acteurs suivant unecertaine affinité (Moreno, 1953) et des acteurs isolés. Par contre, l’interprétation de ce socio-gramme d’affinités et/ou de rejets est parfois difficile (Lancichinetti et al., 2010; Dao et al.,2017).

Social network analysis and machine learning methods take advantage of network topology to detect relational patterns and model interaction behaviors. Specifically, small induced subgraphs called graphlets, provide an efficient topological description of the way each node is embedded in the meso-scale structure of a network. Here we propose to detect the roles occupied by the different participants, students and teachers, in the successive phases of courses modeled by a sequence of static snapshots. The detected positions, obtained thanks to graphlet enumeration combined with a clustering method, reveal the different roles observed in each snapshot. We also track the role changes through the overall sequence of snapshots. We apply our method to the Sqily platform and describe the mutual skill validation process. The detected roles, the transitions between roles and a overall visualization through Sankey diagrams help interpreting the course dynamics. We found that some roles act like necessary steps to engage students within an active exchange process with their classmates.

Particular such diagrams are Sankey diagrams, a visualization tool allowing to depict quantities of flow from one node set to another through a set of links or edges. We use the concept of Sankey diagrams to study the evolution of communities over time in temporal social networks. Particular emphasis is given on temporal motifs such as expansion or contraction of communities, birth or death and especially merging and splitting operations where nodes are transferred from one community to another. Such motifs give an overview on group evolution and are useful to understand social behaviors for large audience communities like online political debates or to make decisions for publishing strategies through the monitoring of co-authorship research papers. The search for an optimal layout of such diagrams can be formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem closely related to crossing minimization in multi-layered graphs. We present and discuss numerical results obtained by solving this problem with hybrid methods based on genetic algorithms and simulated annealing.

The main reasons are those related to course design and learners behavior, according to the requirements of the MOOC provider OpenClassrooms. Two critical business needs are identified in this context. First, the accurate detection of at-risk droppers, which allows sending automated motivational feedback to prevent learners drop-out. Second, the investigation of possible drop-out reasons, which allows making the necessary personalized interventions. To meet these needs, we present a supervised machine learning based drop-out prediction system that uses *Predictive algorithms* (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) for automated intervention solutions, and *Explicative algorithms* (Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree) for personalized intervention solutions. The performed experimentations cover three main axes; (1) Implementing an enhanced reliable dropout-prediction system that detects at-risk droppers at different specified instants throughout the course.

Social commerce, a subset of electronic commerce, is based on social interactions in order to buy and sell goods and services. Nowadays, before buying, people give more importance to the experience feedback they found on internet. However, it is difficult to get an overview of this experience feedback since it is scattered in many online resources, and buyers never have time to read many pages of comments. In this paper, we present an approach which grabs and analyzes experience feedback in order to publish a summary of opinions about a product. We develop this approach with a case study on smartphones and publish a dataset of thousands of comments on a wide range of smartphones. To summarize experience feedback, we use a linguistic appraisal model, based on appreciation, affect and judgement, and we set up an approach using methods and tools from the fields of natural language processing, opinion mining and sentiment analysis.","tags":[],"title":"Opinion mining on experience feedback: A case study on smarphones reviews","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Emilien Gauthier","Laurent Brisson","Philippe Lenca","Stéphane Ragusa"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420066800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603482235,"objectID":"9fc7e6163bfb4bbaccaa0a5762d2dcbc","permalink":"http://www.laurent-brisson.fr/publication/2015-breast-cancer-risk-score/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2015-breast-cancer-risk-score/","section":"publication","summary":"According to the World Health Organization, starting from 2010, cancer has become the leading cause of death worldwide.

Les approches Actuelles, pour évaluer la pertinence des informations extraites, se distinguent en deux catégories : les approches objectives qui mettent en oeuvre des mesures d'intérêt afin d'évaluer les propriétés statistiques des modèles extraits et les approches subjectives qui confrontent les modèles extraits à des connaissances exprimées sur le domaine et nécessitent généralement l'interrogation d'experts. Toutefois, le choix de modèles pertinents en regard de la connaissance métier d'un expert reste un problème ouvert et l'absence de formalisme dans l'expression des connaissances nuit à la mise au point de techniques automatiques de confrontation des modèles permettant d'exploiter toute la richesse sémantique des connaissances expertes. L'approche KEOPS que nous proposons dans ce mémoire, répond à cette problématique en proposant une méthodologie qui intègre les connaissances des experts d'un domaine tout au long du processus de fouille. Un système d'information dirigé par une ontologie (ODIS) joue un rôle central dans le système KEOPS en permettant d'organiser rationnellement non seulement la préparation des données mais aussi la sélection et l'interprétation des modèles générés. Une mesure d'intérêt est proposée afin de prendre en compte les centres d'intérêt et le niveau de connaissance des experts. Le choix des modèles les plus pertinents se base sur une évaluation à la fois objective pour évaluer la précision des motifs et subjective pour évaluer l'intérêt des modèles pour les experts du domaine. Enfin l'approche KEOPS facilite la définition de stratégies pour améliorer le processus de fouille de données dans le temps en fonction des résultats observés. Les différents apports de l'approche KEOPS favorisent l'automatisation du processus de fouille de données, et ainsi, une dynamique d'apprentissage peut être initiée pour obtenir un processus de fouille particulièrement bien adapté au domaine étudié. KEOPS a été mise en oeuvre dans le cadre de l'étude de la gestion des relations avec les allocataires au sein des Caisses d'Allocations Familiales. L'objectif de cette étude a été d'analyser la relation de service rendu aux allocataires afin de fournir aux décideurs des connaissances précises, pertinentes et utiles pour l'amélioration de ce service.","tags":["knowledge","data-mining process"],"title":"Intégration de connaissances expertes dans le processus de fouille de données pour l'extraction d'informations pertinentes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laurent Brisson","Martine Collard","Nicolas Pasquier"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1137452400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603482235,"objectID":"e3cd4d35c0afed3470849faed2ba689f","permalink":"http://www.laurent-brisson.fr/publication/2006-ontologie-fouille-donnees/","publishdate":"2006-01-17T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2006-ontologie-fouille-donnees/","section":"publication","summary":"Le Système d'Information Conceptuel ExCIS pour l'extraction de connaissances est une approche s'inspirant de CRISP- DM et intégrant le support des ontologies.

This methodology describes guidelines for a data mining process like CRISP-DM. Its originality is to build a specific conceptual information system related to the application domain in order to improve datasets preparation and results interpretation. In this paper we specially present the CIS construction which consists of creating an ontology by information extraction from an initial raw database and building data to be mined.","tags":["data-mining process","knowledge"],"title":"Improving the knowledge discovery process using ontologies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laurent Brisson","Nicolas Pasquier","Céline Hébert","Martine Collard"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1095631200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603482235,"objectID":"46be41fc7c1a3ba6ebf5c2f369198328","permalink":"http://www.laurent-brisson.fr/publication/2004-hasar-association-rule/","publishdate":"2004-09-20T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2004-hasar-association-rule/","section":"publication","summary":"We present the HASARD method that is an hybrid approach for extracting adaptative temporal association rules. This method extracts assocation rules between events ccuring in subsequent time-intervals using closed itemsets extraction and evolutionary techniques. An important feature is its capacity to consider different time-intervals depending on the analysed attribute. This method was applied for the analysis of long term medical observations of atherosclerosis risk factors for cardio-vascular diseases prevention. Experimental results show that it is well-suited for extracting knowledge from temporal data where interesting patterns have different observation period length.","tags":["association rule"],"title":"HASAR: mining sequential association rules for atherosclerosis risk factor analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laurent Brisson","Martine Collard","Kevin Le Brigand","Pascal Barbry"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1095631200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603482235,"objectID":"8ee037ae0f369efbd4c3d5fff339358f","permalink":"http://www.laurent-brisson.fr/publication/2004-kta-framework-knowledge/","publishdate":"2004-09-20T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2004-kta-framework-knowledge/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["knowledge"],"title":"KTA: A framework for integrating expert knowledge and experiment memory in transcriptome analysis","type":"publication"}]
